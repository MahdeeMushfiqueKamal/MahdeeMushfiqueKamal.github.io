<h1>About Me</h1>
<div class="post">
  Hi, I am Mahdee Mushfique Kamal, a recent graduate with a BSc degree in
  Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from Bangladesh University of
  Engineering and Technology (BUET). I work remotely as a Software Engineer at
  ELELEM Artificial Intelligence Ltd, where I design and implement large-scale
  AI-powered systems. Previously, I served as a Junior Data Engineer at Concured
  Ltd, contributing to data-driven solutions and backend systems.
  <br />
  I aim to excel as a software engineer in the industry, with plans to pursue a
  PhD and transition into an industry researcher role. My interests lie in Graph
  Theory, Artificial Intelligence, and Software Engineering, and I am eager to
  explore their intersections in future research.
  <br />
  In addition to my technical endeavors, I am a passionate competitive debater
  and have participated in over 30 national and international tournaments. I am
  also proud to have won the DU-IIT HackTheVerse Hackathon and secured 1st
  Runner-Up at the IEEE International Signal Processing Cup 2023. I have served
  as the General Secretary of BUET Debating Club, leading and organizing key
  events while contributing to the club's growth.
