    This research addresses the challenge of generating scale-free networks within specific graph classes. 
    It focuses on caterpillars and series-parallel networks, characterizes the value of Î³ for scale-free caterpillars, 
    and presents an O(n) algorithm to generate them. 
    It also introduces an O(m) algorithm for generating scale-free series-parallel networks.
