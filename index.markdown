Hi, I am Mahdee Mushfique Kamal, a recent graduate with a BSc degree in
Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from Bangladesh University of
Engineering and Technology (BUET). I work remotely as a Software Engineer at
ELELEM Artificial Intelligence Ltd, where I design and implement large-scale
AI-powered systems.
Previously, I served as a Junior Software Engineer at Concured
Ltd, contributing to data-driven solutions and backend systems.



I aim to excel as a software engineer in the industry, with plans to pursue a
PhD and transition into an industry researcher role. My interests lie in Graph
Theory, Network Science, and Artificial Intelligence.



In addition to my technical endeavors, I am a passionate competitive debater
and have participated in over 30 national and international tournaments. I am
also proud to have won the DU-IIT HackTheVerse Hackathon and secured 1st
Runner-Up at the IEEE International Signal Processing Cup 2023. I have served
as the General Secretary of the BUET Debating Club, leading and organizing key
events while contributing to the club's growth.
